## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mostafa!
### Glad to see you here!


I'm an Aspiring biomedical engineer with a passion for innovation and problem-solving. Currently pursuing a degree at Cairo University while gaining hands-on experience through diverse internships and projects. From developing AI-powered solutions at McKinsey and ALX to building robots and creating educational content, I thrive on challenges that blend technology and creativity.

My journey spans IT support, content creation, and leadership roles, equipping me with a unique skill set that combines technical expertise with strong communication abilities. Being able to speak German, English, and Arabic, I'm adept at bridging cultural gaps in global teams.

Always eager to learn and push boundaries, I'm seeking opportunities to apply my skills in cutting-edge biomedical engineering projects. Let's connect and explore how we can innovate together!
